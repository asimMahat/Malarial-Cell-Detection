## General Info 
This a simple Django web application for detecting infectious Malarial Cell. The prediction model is build using PyTorch
(An open source machine learning framework used for applications of research, data science and artificial intelligence). 

## Motivation
The detection of malarial cells using cell imaging provides important clinical information.
This prediction can save doctors time in detecting disease and can be used as a major source of diagnosis. 

## Technologies 
* Python
* PyTorch
* Django
